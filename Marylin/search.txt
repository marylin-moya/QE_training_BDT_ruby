1. Research
	- When and why BDD was defined
	  It is defined to decrease the misunderstandings between POs, devs and QE
	- The most important aspects of BDD
      TDD(Testing, Coding, Design) and ATDD(Automate)
	- why is useful and when could be applied
	  * Collaboration between POs, devs and QE
	  * Simple specification, POs, devs and QE understand the same behavior
	  * Provide early feedback to avoid rework due to misunderstandings
	  * Focus on the behavior of the application
	- which type of teams could implement BDD
	  It is used by the teams that are starting the implementation and defining the testing scenarios at the same time. If the application is already implemented is called BDT
